## Office Hours Calendar

GSI and tutor office hours are in <span style="color:#795548">**brown**</span>. Click on each event to see which GSI and/or tutor is running each office hour time. You should come to these with questions about anything – labs, homeworks, discussions, concepts, etc.

The mode for GSI and office hours has yet to be determined. We will update you before the start of the session.

<!-- To access GSI and tutor office hours, go to our [Office Hours Queue](http://oh.ds100.org). When it’s your turn, you will be given the Zoom link to join. -->

Instructor office hours with Raguvir and Isaac have yet to be scheduled, but they will appear in <span style="color:#b2505b">**dark pink**</span>. You should come to these with questions about concepts. To access instructor office hours, use the Zoom links posted on Piazza.
