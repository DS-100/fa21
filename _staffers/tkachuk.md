Hi! I'm an international rising senior at Berkeley studying CS and Applied Math. I do research in Graph Neural Networks, but am also interested in all things involving business. In my free time I play musical instruments (mainly guitars and piano) and write music, travel, read, listen to music, ski, and swim :) If you are a transfer student, come talk to me!
