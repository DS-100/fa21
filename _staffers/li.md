Hi! I'm Michelle, a rising senior from Maryland studying CS and Data Science. Data100 was one of my favorite courses, so I'm super excited to TA this summer. In my free time I enjoy running, shopping at Trader Joe's, and listening to true crime podcasts. Feel free to reach out about anything at all, and I'm super excited to meet you! :)
