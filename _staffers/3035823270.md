Hi and welcome to Data 100! I'm Anusha, a second year studying CS and DS from San Jose! I'm a HUGE music enthusiast: some of my favorite artists include Loote, Glades, The Band CAMINO, and of course Cardi B. I'm also super passionate about art, and my next project is to paint a pair of shoes! Hit me up for dog pics, music recs, and Data 100 help!
