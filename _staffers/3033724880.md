My name is Connie, and I'm a 4th year EECS major from Sacramento, CA. Last semester, I was a tutor for Data 100 and had so much fun teaching that I came back again as a TA. I am super excited to get to know you all this semester! Talk to me about research in computational biology, hiking places around NorCal, bops, and cooking/eating around here.
