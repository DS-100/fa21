Hi everyone, I'm James! I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science, Data Science, and Applied Mathematics from Jakarta, Indonesia. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies. DATA 100 is definitely one of my favorite classes, and I hope it becomes yours too! Looking forward to a great semester with you all!!
